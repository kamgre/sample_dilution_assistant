# sample_dilution_assistant

#### What?
This is a simple (yet probably not the simplest possible) R script intended to ease some laboratory work during (especially) quantitative analyses.
  

#### Why?
Because we are lazy and forgetful.  
Because we have misestimated our dilutions at least one too many times.
  

#### When?
When you know the approximate concentration of your sample and you are certain that it falls way beyond your fancy calibration curve.
  

#### How?
This script needs you to know at least:
* calibration curve equation, expressed as y = a * x + b
* the boundaries of your curve, expressed as minimal and maximal response OR minimal and maximal concentration
